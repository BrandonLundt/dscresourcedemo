# DSC Resource Demo Material
This repository contains presentation material and demos on designing and developing DSC resources. The demonstrations include both traditional DSC resources using the xDSCResourceDesigner module as well as class-based DSC resources introduced in PowerShell 5.0.

All material was developed and tested with Windows 10 running PowerShell 5.1.16299.

If you would like to learn more about DSC, I recommend getting a copy of [The DSC Book](https://leanpub.com/the-dsc-book). You can find a number of courses I've created about DSC at [Pluralsight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/jeff-hicks). I am also available for private PowerShell-related classes should your company have a number of people requiring training. Email learning@jdhitsolutions.com if you are interested.

**Everything here should be considered educational material and is not considered production ready.**
